# Snapchat – Deep Clone Linked List with Random Pointer

This folder contains the problem statement and two Python solutions for cloning a linked list with random pointers.

## Solutions
solution1.py → Uses a hash map (dictionary) to store mapping of old → new nodes.
solution2.py → Uses O(1) extra space by interleaving original and cloned nodes.

## Run
As this problem requires constructing a linked list, you need to write test cases or integrate with LeetCode/GeeksforGeeks format.
